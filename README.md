# About

This is a 2016 calendar that allows images to be uploaded on each day of December (up to the 25th). Each uploaded image can be viewed individually.

The idea was to upload pictures of people dressed as ピコ太郎 (Piko Taro) for each day.

# Usage

Upload function is still not implemented. Images loaded from `resources/img` are still hard-coded.

If you still want to see it, clone the repository, open index.html in a browser and enjoy :)
